# ROP Primer

This VM is meant as a small introduction to 32-bit return-oriented-programming on Linux. It contains three vulnerable binaries, that must be exploited using ROP.

The machine is built and tested in ```VirtualBox 4.3.20```. It's an Ubuntu 32 bit VM, with ASLR disabled. Useful tools like gdb-peda are installed. A description of the levels, including instructions, can be found on the webserver.

A big shout-out to my team mates of the Vulnhub CTF Team!
