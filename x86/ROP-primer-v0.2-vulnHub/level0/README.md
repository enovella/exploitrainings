Warmup exercise â€“ get started!

Login via ```ssh``` with username ```level0``` and password ```warmup```.

As a warmup exercise, can you exploit the following code:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main(int argc, char **argv, char **argp)
{
  char name[32];
  printf("[+] ROP tutorial level0\n");
  printf("[+] What's your name? ");
  gets(name);
  printf("[+] Bet you can't ROP me, %s!\n", name);
  return 0;
}
```

The objective is to spawn a shell, locally. You can use ```ret2libc``` if you want, or the ```mprotect/read shellcode``` strategy (or any other of your liking =)).

The binary has been compiled on a 32-bit Kali VM and was statically linked. NX should be enabled, ASLR is disabled.
